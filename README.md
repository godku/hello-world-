# hello-world-
Hi I'm Godku if you read this......
As I said I started coding a month ago june 2017(python and ethical hacking).I want to expand my skills in both of fields and become really good.I find both really interesting and fun and i want to learn them!!Plus,(saying it again)i'm searching for other people that are in the same stuff and group up and potentially teach and help one another.
Don't worry i'm nowhere near looking to stalk someone or harm him.Lastly,anyone help me around here and tell what to look for and stuff like that you know(python,ethical hacking and close to that).I want to find courses for starters and understand the community.How github works,the real stuff,short of find a direction not the policies.But everything is great you choose don't think with my preferences so much.I'll be posting my code soon too.

Thank you guys,
Godku
